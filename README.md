# PHY204: Homework 2, Exercise 2

 Programming part of the second homework for PHY204.

Calculates the E and B fields of a system described in the task file. It does so by calculating the magnetic field potential A at a given position by numerically integrating the formula for A using Gauss-Legendre polynomials. Then, using Maxwell's equations, it calculates the E and B fields by numerically calculating the the partial derrivatives of A.
